*"If You Love Something, Set It Free" - March 2, 2015 Tim*


This is the official release of the Marketplace Asset - Horde Template (Native) UE 5.3 also seen here:
https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/horde-template-v2-native-horde-template-framework

I wanted to give the community something back after all these years of game development. So this is now open source.

## - Update 2.6 (UE5.6)
```
    The 5.6 Update is not quite done. ( Pre-release ). It's at least working now.

    - Upgraded to Unreal Engine Version 5.6
    - Changed the Code Base to fit the new Engine Version
    - Fixed some Font Issues in the HUD
    - Fixed HUD Boxes being Rounded Boxes
    - Fixed Animation Crash because of bad references.
    - Fixed Inventory not being properly initialized.
    - Fixed General Inventory Issues
    - Fixed Issue with Spawning the Character
    - Changed the SubCharacter to Blueprints ( We don't need for each Character a new C++ Class )
    - Added some Failsafe Changes.
