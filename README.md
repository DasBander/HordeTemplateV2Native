# Horde Template ( Native ) - UE5.3
*"If You Love Something, Set It Free" - March 2, 2015 Tim*

This is the official release of the Marketplace Asset - Horde Template (Native) UE 5.3 also seen here:
https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/horde-template-v2-native-horde-template-framework

I wanted to give the community something back after all these years of game development. So this is now open source.

I might upgrade this project some day to newer Unreal Engine Versions.
